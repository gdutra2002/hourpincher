## Description

In keeping track of our lives, using a day planner is crucial to successfuly meeting our daily obligations.  By using an online schedule, we can share our plans and have a communitty schedule for people to be aware of events and tasks throughout the day, updated in real time. This schedule is independent from any subscribed callender, thus useful like a tear off day planner on a local machine.
Enjoy!
